This code uses the Pygame library to create a window where the game is displayed. The ball jumps when the spacebar is pressed, and the hurdles move from right to left across the screen. 
If the ball collides with a hurdle, the game ends. 
The ball must avoid hurdles by jumping over them. The game ends if the ball collides with a hurdle.
